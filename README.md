# Video Search App
This app allows the user to search for videos using YouTube API. The App is built with React.js (with hooks) and Semantic UI. I used Axios for handling API interaction and focused on building reusable components that I implemented in several other apps. By default, the app shows current five most trending videos on YouTube.
